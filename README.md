# Marvel Comics Collector

Marvel Comics Collector is an app where users can search for Marvel comics, keep a collection of comics they own or have read or it was a favorite. The app uses Marvel Comics' API where information about characters, issue number, storylines, year created and creator can all be pulled. Users have to login in order to search and save comics into their collection.

*Technologies Used:* Marvel API: https://developer.marvel.com , React JS, Javascript, Mongoose, Express, Node JS, Bootstrap, html, css, heroku, JWT, AJAX

*Planning:* Trello https://trello.com/b/TzFrOEij/marvel-comics-collector

Heroku https://marvelcomics-react-app.herokuapp.com

*Unsolved Problems:* Styling issues with the description. Could add some ternary for when search results come up empty. Problem adding a comic to a collection into the database.

*Future Enhancements:* Use react-window to allow large lists to be rendered efficiently. Comments for comics added to collection. Deleting a comic from collection. Chatroom.
